Transfer Agrim licences

Scope of this project is to create an application for Agrim licence transfers. Licence holders who are unable to use the licence can offer the licence to other users to profit from it. This can prevent forfeiture of licence security and improve TRQ usage.

Agrim licence holders can enter licence detail (CN code, country of origin, TRQ, validity) and unused quantity. Planned feature: the application will send the e-mail notification to users interested in given commodity when licence offer is entered.

Importers can use the application to search for available valid licenses in a given commodity.
