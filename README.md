Agrim licence transfers

Scope of this project is to create an application for Agrim licence transfers. Licence holders who are unable to use the licence can offer the licence to other users to profit from it. This can prevent forfeiture of licence security and improve TRQ usage.

Agrim licence holders can enter licence detail (CN code, country of origin, TRQ, validity) and unused quantity. Planned feature: the application will send the e-mail notification to users interested in given commodity when licence offer is entered.

Importers can use the application to search for available valid licenses in a given commodity.

# To run the application it is necessary to import Commodity first and then CNCodes. 
# Countries can be imported independently.
# For testing purposes 3 users has been created. User_id is part of licence data table. 
# There is a file test_licence.csv in data directory which contains over 40 licences for each commodity to test requests and list.
